Builder Design pattern:
	In this pattern we create object step by step and finally return final object with 
	desired values of attributes.
	We will use Builder class to create properties of main class step by step and 
	then finally we will create build method.
	We will create class User.
	User Class details: -
		properties final userId, userName, address, emailId
		private constructor User();
		we will not create setter only getter will be created
		Inner class details: -
			we will create static inner class (User Builder) with same properties  to 
			create object.
			we will create setters, public constructor.
			need to return object of class from each setter method.
			then we need to create build method which will build our main class object 
			and return it, we will pass object to inner class.			
		In final constructor of class we need to get inner class object n using that 
		we will assign values.
			
		There is another approach if we do not want to use new keyword then we can 
		make constructor of inner class public and we can create another static method 
		which will create new inner class object.  
		
	now in calling class we will use parent class to call inner class Constructor and 
	create properties
